# code-challenge

Code challenge of an Android app that uses the TMDB API to display a list of upcoming moveis, and a detail screen for each movie.

The code I've added addresses:

* Implement the details screen;
* Implement pagination;
* Remove logic from the HomeActivity;
* Get rid of the splash screen;
* Improve network layer maintainability;
* Get rid of the BaseActivity;
* Avoid reloading the data when the orientation changes

It uses, Android paging, Glide, RxJava2 and Retrofit2.
